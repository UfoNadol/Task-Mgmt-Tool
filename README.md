# Task-Mgmt-Tool

Welcome!

Here is what I've created:
  Task Management Tool is an application that allows you to manage your daily tasks. 
  Main funcionalities are:
    -Add tasks
    -Change names of tasks
    -Add description to the task
    -Add status to the task
    -Remove task
    -View removed tasks and their statuses/descriptions and when they were removed
    -Restore removed tasks - If you find out that they weren't finished yet ;)

Installation and how to run:
  -Simply install python 3.9 and libraries: tkinter , datetime
  -Run TMT.py with admin credentials.
  -Have fun/get to work

Planned updates: 
  -Add other languages to the app (so you can choose between them 
  -Create user list and sign tasks to the particular user
